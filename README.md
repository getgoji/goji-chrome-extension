Seeding Sustainability.


Our mission: to make the fashion industry more sustainable.


Sustainability in the fashion industry is becoming a more relevant and well known issue. There are many new companies popping up with a central mission of sustainability, however these tend to be more expensive and might not be as accessible to those on a budget. 

As college students who lack unlimited choices of companies to shop from, we created a tool to help customers compare scores between the brands they are already shopping from. This encourages customers to choose more sustainable options by easily providing them insight into how sustainable these companies are by comparing them against other fashion companies. As a Google Chrome Extension, Gogi will follow you through all of your online shopping, at just a click away!

Goji even allows you to customize which categories specifically mean more to you, as well as providing a comprehensive percentile ranking. By scoring companies based on percentiles, each company's scores are calculated in relation to each other, incentivising companies to increase their sustainability and rise among the percentile ranks. By ranking companies with respect to each other, this eliminates the need to establish what levels are "good" and "bad", as we recognize that sustainability is a complex issue with many factors, and a hard factor to define objectively.

The categories to customize rankings are as follows:
Carbon Emissions
Water Usage
Ethical Sourcing
Labor Rights
Transparency
DEI
